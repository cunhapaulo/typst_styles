# Typst Themes - `typst_styles`

Hello, there. 

It´s been with great joy that I found [Typst](https://typst.app/). It gave me even greater pleasure to know it has been created in Berlin! It is a cloud-based Typesitting sistem, similar to LaTeX in its goals. I was very well impressed and decided to give it a try! I was not let down by what I´ve foud and recomend it to everyone! Then I accepted the chalenge to adapt it to my academic needs. As I used to write documents using LaTeX, my first goal was to create templates as close to what I had already achieved in LaTeX as possible, so here we are.

What I share here is still under improvments and is not yet perfect, but can be a head start to anyone who wishes to write academic documents in Typst, be it in the Typst cloud or on premise with VSCode.

I´d be thankful if you could share your experience, needs and improvements with me.

Hugs.
